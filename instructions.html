			<h2 class="little-headings">Overview</h2>
			<p class="info-bits">
				This is a game of Scattegories, without the hassle of cards or dice. You can play with 2+ players, the only requirement is that everyone can see the screen! This game will select a random 'Scattegories' letter and a random list for you to play with. The timer function alerts you to the end of the round. </p>
			<h2 class="little-headings">What will I need?</h2>

			<p class="info-bits">
				You will need to provide your own pen and paper, or another method of recording your answers. Optional accessories include dictionaries/thesauri, as you may become involved in arguments regarding the appropriateness of your teammates' answers. It is recommended to put all phones away for the duration of the round to avoid cheating. </p>
			<h2 class="little-headings">Instructions</h2>
			<p class="info-bits">
				Each round lasts 3 minutes. Each player should prepare their paper with numbers from 1 - 12. The aim is to write down an answer for each category, beginning with the specified letter. E.g. 'Tom' for 'A boy's name'. You mustn't use the same answer for different categories. Creative answers are encouraged, but may be challenged by your teammates! Alliteration is an acceptable method for increasing your points per answer - e.g. 'Ronald Reagan' for 'U.S. Presidents' = 2 points. </p>

				Let's go! Click on the homepage, select a random letter & list, and start the timer!</p>
