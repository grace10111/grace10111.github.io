'Hatchegories' is a web-based copy of the board game 'Scattegories', which you can use without any fancy gear.

This project was originally written in Python (see on GitHub) and has been transferred into HTML/CSS/JS for portability.
The list items are randomly selected from a list of around 300 items, these can be edited within 'lists.js'.

All credit to the format of the game goes to the creators of Scattegories.
